Our clinical resarch database system consists of clinical trials preformed on patients. This is
potentially an international software as we implemented this to be used by any country's national
health department. The researchers conducting the trials are affiliated with universities and employed
by hospitals for them to be allowed to conduct research. This databaseâ€™s front end was initially built from HTML 
templates and we had edited this template to suit the needs of our project. SCSS is utilized to style the web page 
to be visually appealing, and some premade JavaScript files were utilized for some basic animations. Our group used 
PHP in the backend and utilized MySQL to store the data.
